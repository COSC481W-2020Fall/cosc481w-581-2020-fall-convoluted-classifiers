**Meeting on 10/29/20 - Karen, Baylie & Jacob**

Attempted to connect the AWS server to the Android App using the REST API, however, we were unsuccessful. 

We tried the following:
  - Changing the server url within the Android App
  - Changing the server url through REST
  - Ran the debugging tool on two different machines
  - One machine found an error with the URL that said it was unrecognizable
  - Doubled checked code in the Android App - All the code seemed to be correct and in the appropriate areas.
  - Double checked that the server was running properly
  
The Professor was contacted to help us work through the issues.

We did add code to send the image as a bitmap file to the server, however, the server was down so we were not able to test our code.
As well, the flask file was not published to the repo, so we were not able to adjust the return value in the flask file to send the dog breed back to the moblie app


**Update on 11/8/20 - Baylie**

Jacob implemented some sort of quick fix to get a server up and running. I was able to connect and recieve our feedback data from the server, however, the flask file has still not been published to the repo for us to make changes. I am communicating with Jacob to see how we are going to send the dog breed back to the mobile app.
