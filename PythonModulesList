    	(this videos goes over the basics of OPENCV and also has 3 example projects)
    
ObjectDetection with Image AI:
	https://stackabuse.com/object-detection-with-imageai-in-python/#:~:text=The%20ObjectDetection%20class%20of%20the,kinds%20of%20common%2C%20everyday%20objects.
	This has instructions of how to use and install the module. It also has an example of using it to detect cars and pedestrians in a picture.
