- best pre-trained model for our purpose
    - the model was trained with aniaml photos.
    - high accuracy
    - efficiency
- training result
    - graph
    - testing accuracy
    - validation accuracy
    - summary of the model
- pick a new model
    - according to previous trainging experience, find a new pre-trained model.
- final result
    - testing and validation result of the newest model
