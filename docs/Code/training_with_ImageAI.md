# Training with ImageAI
#### Nov 09 - Nov 16

### After custom prediction training with ImageAI:
    - the final validation accuracy is 0.5126 after 100 epochs.
    - the final training accuracy is 0.9867 after 100 epochs.
    - the model is overfitting on our dataset.
    - it does not perfect support our purpose of our application.

### Next step with ImageAI:
    - training model with ImageAI with small epochs (<20)
    - retrain it across all layers the model has with small epochs (<5).
    - aim to get a model with validation-accuracy higher than 0.9.
    
### Next step without ImageAI:
    - researching on how to add detection layer into model 
    - reseraching on how to use Mask-R-CNN model to classify dog breeds.
    - researching on how to build a model could do detection and classification together.
