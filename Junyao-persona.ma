Junyao is currently a student at Eastern Michigan University. His major is Computer Science Applied, and minors are Economic and Mathematic. He used to ride mountain bike and go-karting for free time.

Junyao is a person really like dogs, but he has never had his own dog. However, he always goes to his girlfriendâ€™s apartment and pets her dog, Yanjing. Junyao and Yanjing are good friends right now.

He does not have much time to read books about dogs or research on the internet for any detail of our four-legged friends. Junyao is thinking about how to recognize any breed of dogs as quick as just taking a picture by smart phone when he catches sight of a dog.

To some extent he cannot own a dog currently, Junyao really wants to have a dog, he thus always open to help his friends to take care of their dogs. Thus, he needs to know details and information about how to take care of the specific breed of dog without spending much time on the internet. He wishes there would be an application that could make the whole process easier.
