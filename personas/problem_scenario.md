# Problem Scenario
- What problems/needs does the persona have in your area?
- What alternatives do they have? Instead of using your product, what do they do right now to solve this problem/meet this need?
- What are your product ideas for the problems?

The needs of our persona includes a fast working, easy to use, and accurate application that can detect a dogs breed. 
The persona's alternatives are googling dogs features, other dog detecting apps, friends and family, and looking at dog book.

Our product ideas for those problems are training our model with different breeds to get a more accurate analysis, have our application have a clean and simple interface that is easy to use, ensure the server is quick and with minimal latency.
