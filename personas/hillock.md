# Persona for Jacob Hillock
Jacob is an avid dog lover. He loves looking out of his window in his apartment and seeing the occasional doggo. However, he is garbage at knowing what kind of breed that dog is. Currently, he relies on his roommates, friends, and family to tell him what the bread of any specific dog is. His only alternatives are looking up potential dog breed and seeing if that fits, looking up all dog breeds and seeing which one looks closest, or just never knowing what breed of dog that is.

Jacob is a data science major at eastern michigan university. He enjoys spending his time coding, watching videos, learning, and seeing dogs on the internet. He tends to walk from his apartment to class while he listens to music or a podcast. However, slowness irritated him, if he tries to use a piece of tech that takes forever to load or pair or is riddled with ads, he deletes them and forgets they ever existed.

Jacob has three dogs himself. He has two Shih Tzu puppies named Penny, who is entirely white, and Maggie, who is white and brown, and a Papillon Ernie, who is entirely white also. His partner has a Boston Terrier name Lizzy, who is black and white. (Fun fact, you can see these dogs in the .positives dataset with dogs 61-72).
