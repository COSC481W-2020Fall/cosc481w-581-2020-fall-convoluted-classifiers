# Prototype Description
--Finalizing this description after our meeting on Friday--

For our prototype we would like to create a way to automatically detect a canine animal inside an image file using Python. We will have a folder in our machine's document library containing **5?** canine images, as well as **10?** images of other animals, that our program will search through. Our Python program will use ___ modules and it will be able to detect which of the images in that folder are of canines and output the filenames. Ideally we will be using the command line prompt to provide user input,run the program, and display any output.
