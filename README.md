# Prototype Description

For our prototype we would like to create a way to automatically detect a canine animal inside an image file using Python. We will have a folder in our Github repository containing approx. 100 canine images, that our program will search through. Our Python program will use the tensorflow, openCV, keras, and imageAI modules and it will be able to detect which of the images in that folder are of canines and output "yes" if it is a dog and "no" if it is not. We will be using the command line prompt to provide user input,run the program, and display any output.
