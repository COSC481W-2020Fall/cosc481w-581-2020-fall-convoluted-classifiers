Meeting on 10/29/20 - Karen, Baylie & Jacob

Attempted to connect the AWS server to the Android App using the REST API, however, we were unsuccessful. 

We tried the following:
  - Changing the server url within the Android App
  - Changing the server url through REST
  - Ran the debugging tool on two different machines
  - One machine found an error with the URL that said it was unrecognizable
  - Doubled checked code in the Android App - All the code seemed to be correct and in the appropriate areas.
  - Double checked that the server was running properly
  
The Professor was contacted to help us work through the issues.
