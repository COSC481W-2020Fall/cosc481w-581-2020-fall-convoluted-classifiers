# Baylie & Karen Meeting 10/6/20 7pm

User Story 2 Task: Research how to integrate the server - Baylie & Karen (Oct 12)

- Both attempted to install AWS Amplify to begin testing if this is an item that we can use and we ran into installation issues on our  education accounts. AWS was not allowing us to create an IAM user, so we contacted the professor about this issue to see if she can help.
